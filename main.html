	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>In computer science, Time Complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution as a function of the length of the input. It is crucial to analyze the time complexity of algorithms to ensure they are efficient, especially for large input sizes.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b>, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the input size. It is often denoted using Big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis helps in understanding how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources.</p>
